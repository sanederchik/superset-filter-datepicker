# Description

Customized `Filter Box` with included `date-picker` filter.

# Initialization

1. Replace a `superset` [`FilterBox` folder](https://github.com/apache/superset/tree/master/superset-frontend/src/visualizations/FilterBox) with a `FilterBox` folder from this repo.

2. Go to a `superset-frontend` folder.

3. Make sure `node` and `npm` are installed. Be careful about versions - they should be `v16` and `v7` respectfully.

4. Install a `react-dates` library. Version `^21.8.0` is recommended.

    Install other libraries if needed.

5. Run `npm run dev-server`. If build is done succesfully, it means everything is OK.
